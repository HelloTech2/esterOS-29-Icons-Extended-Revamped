# esterOS-29-Icons-Extended-Revamped
Coming soon esterOS 29 Extended &amp; Revamped Icons... Coming in unknown date

# Shane, please send a esterOS 29 ISO for adapting the icons to 3rd-Party programs and some other fixes...

## I need the souces of esterOS to check if I can find the icons and fixing it and adapting the new icons to 3rd-Party apps and making the icons more consistent with the design. ```The esterIcons unconsistency with 3rd-Party app is a very big problem that happens in all the esterOS desktop versions and in the folders of that icon theme I find some icons that's not showing bc the name is no the same as the program command or identificator```
